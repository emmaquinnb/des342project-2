				<body>Think of three people you would feel comfortable talking to about your feelings then talk to, call, or text one of them. Even just talking to someone can help make you feel better, whether you talk about the problem or not.</body>

		<div>
			<body>You can talk to them about how you are feeling and explain what is going on. Or all you have to say is I am feeling stressed or anxious, but I do not want to talk about it.</body>
