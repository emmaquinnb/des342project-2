				<body><strong>Stress</strong> is mainly focused on external pressures that we are aware of, such as, a tight deadline for an assignment or having an argument with a friend. It is best to tackle these head on, and once the problem is resolved the stress usually disappears. Stress is like a muscle the more you take on the more you are able to handle the next time.

			<body><strong>Anxiety</strong> is focused on internal pressures that are a reaction to stress. We are not always aware of these problems, and are not as easy to figure out. Anxiety is characterized by feelings of worry and tension, and people may avoid certain situations because of these feelings. Build up of smaller stressors and big events can trigger anxiety.
